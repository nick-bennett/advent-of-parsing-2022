# Most of the time splitlines() is the best solution

```bash
$ cat example2.txt
This is line numero uno
This is line numero dos
This is line numero tres
```

```python
>>> with open("./example2.txt", "r") as file:
...     data = file.read()
... 
>>> data
'This is line numero uno\nThis is line numero dos\nThis is line numero tres\n'
>>> data.splitlines()
['This is line numero uno', 'This is line numero dos', 'This is line numero tres']
```

## This even work on single line files:

```bash
$ cat example1.txt
This is line
```

```python
>> with open("./example1.txt", "r") as file:
...     data = file.read()
... 
>>> data
'This is a line\n'
>>> data.splitlines()
['this is a line']
```

### Note that you can put the splitline method pretty early

```python
>> with open("./example1.txt", "r") as file:
...     data = file.read().splitlines() # <---------
... 
>>> data
['this is a line']
```

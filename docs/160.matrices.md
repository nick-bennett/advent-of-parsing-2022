## When to use this: general idea

- File is presented as a full square or rectangle.
- The problem describes location, or position as `x, y` or `row, column`.
- Things move from one position to another.

Caveat: Even if we decide as a fisrt step to parse the file as a matrix, consider that there could be an extra step to solve the problem at scale (usually a matter on part 2s).

## Immutable matrix

If we don't intent to modify the matrix, we could just keep the rows as strings. If so, it a case that we already cover. More on that later.

```python
def parse(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        data = file.read().splitlines()
    
    return data
```

## Example output for day 8

```python
[
    "30373",
    "25512",
    "65332",
    "33549",
    "35390",
]
```

## Why this works

A Python string allow us to access individual characters using an index:

```python
>>> s = "abcdef"
>>> s
'abcdef'
>>> s[0]
'a'
>>> s[1]
'b'
```

So it is possible to treat the latter list of strings as a matrix:

```python
>>> m = [
...     "30373",
...     "25512",
...     "65332",
...     "33549",
...     "35390",
... ]
>>> 
>>> m[0][0]
'3'
>>> m[1][2]
'5'
```

## Navegate the object

```python
for row_number, row in enumerate(m):
    for col_number, item in enumerate(row):
        print(m[row_number][col_number])
```

or for a rectangular matrix:

```python
for row in range(len(m)):
    for col in enumerate(len(m[0])):
        print(m[row][col])
```

## Why this is _Immutable_

Because you can't modify it:

```python
>>> m[2][3]
'3'
>>> m[2][3] = 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

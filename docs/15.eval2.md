# Use `literal_eval` from `ast` instead

This function is usually reffered as a _**save eval**_.

```python
from ast import literal_eval

def parse(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        data = file.read()

    output = []
    for block in data.split("\n\n"):
        output.append([literal_eval(l) for l in block.splitlines()])

    return output
```
